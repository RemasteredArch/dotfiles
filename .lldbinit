# .lldbinit: Configurations for LLDB

# Ideally, this would have a \n like the GDB prompt, but that behavior is bugged,
# at least in 18.1.3 on Ubuntu 24.04
settings set prompt "$ lldb > "

# Use Python to set prompt with username

# Best reference for ANSI options is the source:
# https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/lldb/include/lldb/Utility/AnsiTerminal.h
