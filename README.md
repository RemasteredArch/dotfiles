# Dotfiles

A collection of my miscellaneous scripts and configuration files.
Designed for Ubuntu 24.04 [on WSL](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nz3klhxdjp5).

Organized as if it will be copied directly to `$HOME`,
such as with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).
If you use an unusual `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`,
you'll have to adjust `.config/` to that directory as necessary.

## Scripts

The `scripts/` directory has two subdirectories:

### `dotfiles/`

- `gnome_keyring_setup.sh`
  - A simple script for setting up [GNOME Keyring](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeKeyring/).
- `git_commit_signing_setup.sh`
  - A script for setting up GPG key signing for Git.
    - Generates a signing key,
      configures the Git CLI to use it for commits,
      and prints its public key.
  - Does not configure the server-side authentication of commits on Git hosts like GitHub,
    the public key generated by the script must be uploaded manually.
- `install.sh`
  - A script to install and configure a fresh installation of Ubuntu 24.04 as per my preferences.
  - Mostly involves installing and setting up various dev tools.
  - This is COMPLETELY UNTESTED!
    Use at your own risk!
  - On a fresh install, run:

```bash
# Again, this is COMPLETELY UNTESTED!
install_script="$(mktemp --directory -t 'dotfiles.install.XXXXXXXX')/install.sh" \
  && curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RemasteredArch/dotfiles/main/scripts/dotfiles/install.sh' -o "$install_script" \
  && chmod u+x "$install_script" \
  && "$install_script"
# DO NOT RUN THIS if you are not certain that is is okay!
```

- `number_conversion.sh`
  - Provides a number of simple functions for
    binary, decimal, and hexadecimal conversions.
- `clock.sh`
  - Provides a simple TUI clock.

### `virtman/`

- `virtman.sh`
  - A script for installation and management of
    [Qemu](https://www.qemu.org/) virtual machines.
- `default.toml`
  - Default configuration values for `virtman.sh`.
  - See `virtman.sh --help` for more info on configuration.

## See also

I organize some other configurations under their own repositories:

- My Neovim configuration,
  available at [`nvim-config`](https://github.com/RemasteredArch/nvim-config)
  (maps to `~/.config/nvim/`).
- My tmux configuration,
  available at [`tmux-config`](https://github.com/RemasteredArch/tmux-config)
  (maps to `~/.config/tmux/`).
- My update script,
  available at [`Updater`](https://github.com/RemasteredArch/Updater).

All of these are installed by the [install script](#scripts).
