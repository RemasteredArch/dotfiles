# Dotfiles

A collection of my miscellaneous configuration files. Organized as if it will be copied directly to `$HOME`, such as with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). If you use an unusual `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, you'll have to adjust `.config/` to that directory as necessary.

## See also

I organize some other configurations under their own repositories:
* My neovim configuration, available at [`nvim-config`](https://github.com/RemasteredArch/nvim-config)
* My tmux configuration, available at [`tmux-config`](https://github.com/RemasteredArch/tmux-config)
